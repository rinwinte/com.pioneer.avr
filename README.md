# Pioneer AVR Control for Athom Homey

Control your Pioneer AV-Receiver with your Homey.

This app connects via Telnet to the Pioneer AVR and monitors the netwerk status using SSDP. Therefore, it is not required to set a static IP address. However, in order to use the ON button and for better performance it is required to enable Network Standby, see details below.

This app uses the default port of the device which in most cases is 8102. Homey claims this port as long as the device is powered and releases it only on power down. Keep this in mind when trying to use Telnet from another source such as a computer or the official Pioneer app.

## Features
Action Flow Cards:
* Turn your Pioneer AVR on and off
* Increase or decrease volume with steps of 0.5dB
* Set volume to a fixed dB value
* Mute/Unmute or toggle mute

Conditoin Flow Cards:
* Is the Pioneer AVR powered on?
* Is the Pioneer AVR muted?

## Supported Devices
Most Pioneer models that can be controlled grough Telnet should work.

Please let me know if your Pioneer model is supported.

## Configuring Network Standby
The Network Standby option is required to control the Pioneer receiver even when it is off. In order to turn the device on again this setting has to be ON. Furthermore, it ensures a stable connection with the device.
